A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output\
What the working directory was when the command was run\
A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).\
Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it’s an error, explain why it’s an error.\

# 1. cd
  1-1. the command with no arguments\
  ![Image](1-1.png)\
  The working directory was nothing when the command was run. cd means to change the current directory to the given path. Therefore, since there was no argument, we can't switch the current directory and that's why nothing happened when the command was run. The output is not an error.\
  1-2. the command with a path to a directory as an argument\
  ![Image](1-2.png)\
  The working directory was messages when the command was run. It is because the current directory was switched to messages from lecture1. The output is not an error.\
  1-3. the command with a path to a file as an argument\

  There wasn't any working directory when the command was run because 

# 2. ls

   ![Image](2-3.png)

# 3. cat
   3-1. the command with no arguments\
   ![Image](3-1.png)\
   The working directory was lecture1 when the command was run. cat prints the contents of one or more files given by the path, but since there is no argument, it can't print anything. That's why there is nothing when the command was run. Output is not an error.\
